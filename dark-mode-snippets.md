# Dark Mode
These are some useful snippets to use when converting an older template to make it dark mode friendly. **Note: All of these elements are already included in the starter template.**



## Dark Mode Friendly Meta Tags

```
VSCode Snippet Shortcut: lt-dm-meta-tags
```

This inserts the below shared asset:
```
<shared_asset> bsft_LT_Logo__Rebrand__v1__darkmode__friendly2 </shared_asset>
```
You should use this snippet to overwrite the the existing logo shared asset. This currently only works for templates branded only as LendingTree.


## Dark Mode Friendly CSS

```
VSCode Snippet Shortcut: lt-dm-css
```

This inserts the CSS necessary for dark mode to render properly. You should place this just inside the CSS style tag in the header section.



## Dark Mode Friendly Logo Shared Asset

```
VSCode Snippet Shortcut: lt-dm-logo
```

This inserts the below shared asset:
```
<shared_asset> bsft_LT_Logo__Rebrand__v1__darkmode__friendly2 </shared_asset>
```



## Dark Mode Friendly App Download and Social Media Icons 

```
VSCode Snippet Shortcut: lt-dm-social
```

This inserts the below shared asset:
```
<shared_asset> bsft_My_LT_App_Download__darkmode__friendly </shared_asset>
```

You should use this snippet to insert this shared asset right above the footer
